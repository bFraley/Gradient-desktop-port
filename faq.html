        <div class="faq_q">What is Gradient?</div>
        <p>
        Gradient is a 2D grid world in which artificial "lifeforms" live. These
        are simulated agents (virtual robots) which can perceive their
        surroundings, perform computations using their simulated neural network
        "brains", and act on these. The agents require energy to live and so
        they need to eat virtual plants and drink virtual water every so often
        in order to survive. They can also reproduce. This is what makes them a
        form of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life">artificial life</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">How does Gradient work?</div>
        <p>
        The agents in the gradient world initially start with randomly connected
        brains. These are recurrent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural networks</a>
        The agents perceive the world as a series of boolean values indicating the contents
        of the grid cells around them. The grid world is updated iteratively. At each
        iteration, the agents perceive their environment, perform computations, and get
        to pick an action to perform (e.g.: turn left, turn right, move forward, consume
        food or water, produce offspring).
        </p>
        <p>
        Gradient implements a kind of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a>.
        The world is initially seeded with randomly created agents. If the agents
        do not eat food and drink water, they run out of energy and die. Inevitably,
        some of the agents will die of starvation. If some agents manage to eat some
        food and drink water, they gain energy, which allows them to survive longer.
        If the number of agents in the world dips below a minimum number, more
        random (seed) agents will be created to maintain a minimum population size.
        </p>
        <p>
        If an agent accumulates enough energy, it will be allowed to choose to
        voluntarily reproduce. This has an associated energy cost, and produced a
        new agent based on a mutated version of it's parent's neural network.
        Because of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a>,
        the agents eventually develop enough "intelligence" to survive. That is,
        the agents with brains that allow them to survive more effectively
        become the most prevalent.
        </p>
        <p>
        The hope is that eventually, agents that are capable of seeking food
        and surviving long enough to reproduce will prevail, and the population
        will maintain itself on its own. The world then no longer needs to be
        seeded with random agents. Note that there is no upper limit on the
        population size, it is purely limited by the availability of food in
        the world.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">How long does it take the agents to become intelligent?</div>
        <p>
        If you let the simulation run in &quot;fast mode&quot;, it will run as fast
        as your computer will allow. The amount of time required for the agents to
        exhibit some degree of &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior (e.g.: looking for
        food and water) can vary. In some instances, the simulation does not seem to
        converge at all, and may be restarted by refreshing the webpage. I recommend
        you let it run for over 10 minutes in fast mode and see what happens.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">Who programmed Gradient? How did it originate?</div>
        <p>
        I, Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, programmed Gradient in my spare time a few
        years ago. It was originally written in C++ and only ran on Linux under
        GTK. I extended Gradient in 2009 to test some ideas for a neuroscience
        class project. In May 2011, I decided to port this program to JavaScript
        so that more people can see it and experiment with it. I believe it's
        also a potentially interesting and demanding JavaScript benchmark.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">Is Gradient open source?</div>
        <p>
        Yes, all the JavaScript code for Gradient is licensed under the GPLv3. You
        are free to download the code, modify it and experiment with it, so long as
        you respect the terms of the GPL license.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">What browsers does Gradient support?</div>
        <p>
        Gradient has been tested on the latest Google Chrome and Firefox. It requires
        support for the HTML5 canvas element to run, and is rather demanding in terms
        of JavaScript performance. At the time of this writing, the latest Internet
        Explorer does not support the canvas element and so will not be able to run
        Gradient. We recommend Google Chrome for best performance.
        </p>

        <div class="faq_q">Are there other artificial life programs out there?</div>
        <p>
        Most definitely. I recommend doing a Google search for artificial life. One
        of the most interesting examples I have found is 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyworld">Polyworld</a>, which is
        actually quite similar to Gradient.
